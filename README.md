### about

hi there! I'm <ins>Fuon</ins>, an 18-year-old developer from China. In Chinese online communities, I go by <ins>Ling Yu</ins>. I specialize in front-end web development and UI design, while currently learning Rust and working toward becoming a full-stack developer.

well, that's all for my personal passion, like "want to build the most user-friendly applications", "want to realize some pursuit in the field of some products" or "try to deliver the meaningful of software development beyond the fast-pac nature".

when it comes to development philosophy, I prioritize meaningful work over methodology. I tend to shy away from rigid frameworks like "agile development" or other prescriptive approaches, preferring instead to build software at a pace that allows me to fully engage with my thoughts.

outside of coding, I'm an amateur fingerstyle guitarist and writer. My passion lies more in arts and literature than mathematics or science - which might explain why I sometimes struggle with algorithms. :)
